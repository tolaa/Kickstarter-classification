# Kickstarter-classification
Kickstarter is a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing creative project to life.
Until now, more than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fueling creative projects.
The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.

Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis i.e if a project doesn’t meet it goal, the project owner gets nothing.
For example: if a projects’s goal is $5000. Even if it gets funded till $4999, the project won’t be a success.

If you have a project that you would like to post on Kickstarter now, I have built a basic Decision Tree model to predict whether it will be successfully funded or not?
